Study Design

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 



Raw Data Information:
The raw data for the exercise was downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

A full description of the raw data can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
The purpose of the project is described as:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 
* A tidy data set 
* A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
* A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
* A README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

Process
The scripts were written using RStudio version 0.98.501 and R version 3.03 on Windows 7 (64 Bit).
* The following data were loaded into R using read.table with header = FALSE
o Activity_labels.txt
o Features.txt
o Subject.txt
* The following test data were loaded into R using read.tables with stringsAsFactors = FALSE and header = FALSE
o Subject_test.txt
o X_test.txt
o y_test.txt
* The following training data were loaded into R using read.tables with stringsAsFactors = FALSE and header = FALSE
o Subject_train.txt
o X_train.txt
o y_train.txt
* The test and training subject data frames were combined using rbind
* The test and training activity data frames were combined using rbind 
* The test and training data frames were combined
* The supplied features were cleansed by
o Changing to all lower case
o Removing all punctuation and non alphabetic characters from the names
* The cleansed names were added to the data frame
* Using grep, the data frame was filtered to select only Mean and std values per the project instructions.
* The data frame was further filtered to include only jerk and accelerate values to support the design. 
* The activity and activitylabels were combined using sqldf to create a simple data frame of activity and activity label.
* The activity data frame was used to add subject and activity columns to the project data frame using cbind and the column names changed to subject and activity.
* The data frame was aggregated using the mean of each value on subject and activity using aggregate and the sorted bu subject using order.
* The resultant data frame was aggregated by Subject and Activity with the mean value of each variable.
* The data fram was written to jerkyAcceleration.txt in the project database
* The following values were written to github
o Run_analysis.R
o README.md
o CodeBook.md
o jerkyAcceleration.txt
